Container registries are places where container images are stored and organized. They are like libraries for container images.

Container repositories are container registries that also manage container images and the files that go with them. They are like special libraries that have tools and supplies for working on container images.

Artifacts are the files that go with container images. They can include things like code, data, and configuration files.

The three major cloud container registries are Azure Container Registry (ACR), AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Google Container Registry (GCR). They are like the biggest libraries for container images.

When choosing a container registry, it is important to consider things like features, security, and cost.
